# Description

The "Cookie Alert | Local Storage" project aims to provide a cookie consent alert box for websites that utilize local storage to remember the user's consent preference. When a user visits the website, they will be presented with a cookie alert box that informs them about the use of cookies on the site. The user can then choose to accept the cookies by clicking the "Accept" button.

The project consists of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file defines the structure of the cookie alert box, including the text message and the accept button. The CSS file contains the styles to customize the appearance of the cookie alert box. The JavaScript file handles the functionality of showing and hiding the cookie alert box and storing the user's consent preference in the local storage.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and provide a user-friendly experience for website visitors. By displaying a cookie consent alert, the project allows website owners to inform users about the use of cookies and obtain their consent.

The project utilizes local storage to remember the user's consent preference. If the user accepts the cookies, their preference is stored in the local storage, and the cookie alert box will no longer be displayed on subsequent visits.

By implementing this project, website owners can demonstrate their commitment to user privacy and comply with relevant data protection laws. It provides transparency and empowers users to make informed decisions about their data.

Please note that while this project addresses the cookie consent aspect, it does not handle the actual implementation of cookie functionality on the website. The project's focus is solely on displaying the cookie alert and managing the user's consent preference.

Feel free to modify and adapt this project to suit your specific website requirements and design preferences.
